But whilst almost all of them had made something of themselves, our star, Nam Laks was still depending on her dad to get whatever she wants.</span></p><p><span>Yet she was affectionately referred to as “The Blair Waldorf of Thailand.”</span></p><p><span>However, her extravagant lifestyle might soon be coming to an end as her father was thinking of cutting her off upon graduation if she didn’t stand on her own two feet in New York — the other alternative was to return to Thailand.</span></p><p><span>For those who missed the drama&nbsp; Nam’s decision to shop for dresses even though she didn’t necessarily “needed” them, was the last straw for her father. As featured in ep 2, she and Vika Abbyaeva go shopping for dresses during a break between her university classes. There, she tells Vika, “It’s fine, my daddy will pay,” when it came to the bill. But after the shopping spree, Nam’s brother told her “After graduation, Dad said you’re on your own, Nam”&nbsp; and also added that their father would “cancel her card” as she “spends too much.”</span></p><h3><b>How Old Is Nam Laks?</b></h3><p><span>Nam Laks was 28 years of age when she appeared on </span><i><span>Bling Empire: New York</span></i><span> in 2023.</span></p><p><span>She was the second younger cast that season — the youngest being Vika Abby (27 then).</span></p><h3><b>Nam Laks Family</b></h3><p><span>Nam Laks comes her an affluent Thai family. Even the star said that her family was “powerful.”</span></p><p><span>Her father, Nakorn Laksanakarn is a Thai businessman who was the Chief Executive Officer of </span><i><span>Natural Park PCL</span></i><span> (NPARK). The company in Bangkok was later renamed </span><i><span>U City Public Company</span></i><span> in 2015.

The Laks siblings share a tight-knit bond.</span></p><p><span>Her bother, Nino turned 26 on August 10, 2022. He is a </span><i><span>Bloxham School</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>International School Bangkok (ISB)</span></i><span> graduate.

Here’s her FB @</span><a href=#><span>kingkarn.laksanakarn</span></a><span>.</span></p><h3><b>Nam Laks Net Worth</b></h3><p><span>Fans of </span><i><span>Bling Empire</span></i><span> know that Nam Laks relied on her father’s credit card. So, it’s hard to say what the star is actually worth. However, if we were to look at the Laks family as one, their net worth is probably was the $100 million range in 2023.</span></p><p><span>As for Nam’s education, she attended International </span><i><span>School Bangkok, Harrow International School,</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Woldingham School</span></i><span>, and later got her Bachelor’s degree from the </span><i><span>University of Manchester</span></i><span> and a Master’s degree from </span><i><span>Teachers College, Columbia University</span></i><span>.</span></p><p><span>According to Nam, the only reason she got her Master’s was that this was one of her dad’s biggest dreams. “Like, he just loves when his children graduate,” she explained. Also, her dad wanted to graduate from NY to help her step out of her sheltered upbringing and her comfort zone.</span></p><p><span>Nevertheless, Nam’s newfound independence wasn’t financial in any way. She didn’t control her extravagant spending habits, nor did she take on any part-time job. Infact, she even hired a personal stylist who dressed her for school and events.</span></p><p><span>“I am definitely daddy’s little girl, but my dad doesn’t always spoil me. There’s a whole list of how to get daddy to say yes,” she said.</span></p><h3><b>Is Nam Laks Dating Anyone?</b></h3><p><span>Nam Laks wasn’t public about her dating life. But considering her IG posts where she was likely having romantic intimate dinners (always with loads of flowers), she might have a boyfriend. And it’s not Kristoff.</span></p><p><span>Though Nam confessed that she liked Kristoff as he was a “really nice guy,” she friend-zoned him before they could go any further!</span></p><p><span>Looking back, Nam first met Kristoff at a bar in the Bahamas after Lynn Ban practically pushed the charmer towards Nam. The two chatted for a while and later, Kristoff even paid for Nam’s flight back.</span></p><p><span>Thereafter, the duo kept in touch via texts, as friends.</span></p><h3><b>Nam Laks Height</b></h3><p><span>Nam Laks stands tall at a height of under 5 feet 4 inches (162 cm).</span></p><p><span>Mentioning her district features, Nam has brown hair and eyes, an oval face, and a perfect body.</span></p><h3><b>Related FAQs</b></h3><ul><li><h4><b>When Is Nam Laks Birthday?</b></h4></li></ul><p><span>Nam celebrates her birthday on February 4 and is of the Aquarius zodiac.</span></p><ul><li><h4><b>Is Nam Laks On Instagram?</b></h4></li></ul><p><span>As of Jan 2023, find her on Instagram @</span><a href=#><span>namlaks</span></a><span> with 11.6K followers.</span></p><p><span>Also, here’s her Facebook @</span><a href=#><span>NamLaks</span></a><span>.</span></p><ul><li><h4><b>Is Nam Laks Still In New York?</b></h4></li></ul><p><span>No, as of 2023, Nam is primarily residing in Bangkok, Thailand.
