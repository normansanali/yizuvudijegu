While she only lasted on SNL for one season, she was part of a very memorable cast that included Adam Sandler, Chris Farley, David Spade, and Mike Myers. In her short time at SNL she impersonated many famous women, including Madonna, Martha Stewart, Pamela Anderson, and even First Lady Hilary Clinton.

However, she has also undertaken numerous other creative projects. In 1999, she co-wrote a book with Ben Stiller called Feel This Book: An Essential Guide to Self-Empowerment, Spiritual Supremacy, and Sexual Satisfaction. The book, which was a humorous parody of popular self-help books, became a New York Times bestseller. She made her one and only foray into directing in 2001 when she made a short film called Housekeeping. From 2004 until 2006, Garofalo hosted a program on the Air America radio network called The Majority Report.

She has done many, many projects over the years, but they are often smaller productions with a niche audience, which explains why she isn't incredibly wealthy despite having played so many roles over the past thirty years.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Rolling Stone Says This Massive Movie Star Is The Worst SNL Cast Member Ever</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGhko5memq6vsYygmKunlpa5sHnSmquuqpSWxm66yKCfrWWcnsOmecKaqZ6domKur7CMp5ytZaekv7W0jGtna2lf</p></div><div id=links><a href=./what-is-standard-size-for-half-bath-html.html>&#171;&nbsp;What is standard size for half bath?</a>
