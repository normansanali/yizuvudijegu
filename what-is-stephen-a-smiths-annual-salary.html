Smith is one of the most well-known figures in sports media today, having built a reputation for himself as a passionate and outspoken personality. One of the things that has made him so famous is his high salary, which has been the subject of much speculation and debate over the years. So just how much does Stephen A. Smith make each year?

Nevertheless, it is clear that he is one of the highest-paid media members in the world of sports.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>Smith's salary has been a topic of much discussion on social media, with some suggesting that it highlights the underpayment of others in the industry. For example, Nick Saban, the head coach of the Alabama Crimson Tide football team, earns $9 million per year, despite not being a media personality. This has led some to question whether Smith's high salary is justified or whether it is simply a reflection of the inequality that exists in the world of sports media.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>Despite the controversy surrounding his salary, there is no denying that Smith has had an impressive career in sports media. He has worked in a variety of roles over the years, including as a news clerk, journalist, radio host, and TV personality. His rise to fame began in the 1990s, when he worked as a writer for the Philadelphia Inquirer. He later became a regular commentator on ESPN's "First Take" program, where his passionate and sometimes controversial opinions earned him many fans and detractors alike.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>Today, Smith is one of the most powerful figures in sports media, and he is widely regarded as a trailblazer in the industry. He has been a vocal advocate for diversity and inclusion, and he has used his platform to speak out on a variety of social and political issues. He is also known for his philanthropic work, having launched the Stephen A. Smith Family Foundation to help underprivileged children in his hometown of New York City.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>One of the reasons why Smith is so successful is that he is a master of self-promotion. He is not afraid to speak his mind and to promote himself and his brand at every opportunity. This has helped him to build a massive following on social media, where he has over 5 million followers on Twitter alone. He has also been the subject of numerous memes and viral videos, which have helped to increase his visibility and popularity.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>Another factor that has contributed to Smith's success is his ability to adapt to changing trends and technologies. For example, he has been a strong supporter of blockchain technology and NFTs, which are becoming increasingly popular in the world of sports memorabilia. He has also embraced new platforms like Clubhouse, where he has hosted several high-profile discussions with other sports personalities.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>Stephen A.
