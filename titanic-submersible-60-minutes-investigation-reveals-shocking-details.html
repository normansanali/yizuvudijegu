He reported hearing loud, gunshot-like noises every three to four minutes during the underwater journey. Such disturbances, especially in the depths of the ocean, should have raised serious concerns about the craft’s safety. When Stanley attempted to voice his worries, he found himself in a heated argument with Rush.</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Ignored_Warnings_and_Lack_of_Experience></span><span><strong>Ignored Warnings and Lack of Experience</strong></span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span>Despite Stanley’s earnest attempts to address the issue, Rush seemingly dismissed the concerns about the carbon-fiber hull and did not possess sufficient experience in operating submersibles.
