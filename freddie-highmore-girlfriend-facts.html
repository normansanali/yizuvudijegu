Judging by the cute Instagram snaps she shares of the two of them, the pair are seemingly head over heels in love with each other. The Little Miss Sunshine star is known to be extremely private about her love life.</p><p>As per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><i>Independent</i></a>, Abigail opened about being sexually assaulted by someone she was in a relationship with and not reporting it to the police because she was afraid they would not believe her.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fans Applaud Congresswoman AOC For Opening Up About Her History Of Sexual Assault</a></span></p><p>She revealed, "I did not report my rape. I didn’t report it because of many reasons," she said. “First off, I was in complete shock and total denial. I didn’t want to view myself as a ‘victim’ so I suppressed it and pretended it never happened."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She went on to say, "Second of all, I was in a relationship with my rapist and feared not being believed.
