Many people overlook the fact that he was formerly married and has children. Hader met his wife, Maggie Carey, in Los Angeles via her college buddies. Carey, like him, works in the entertainment sector. She works behind the camera as a writer, producer, and director, rather than in front of it.</p><h2>Bill Hader Married Life</h2><p>Hader and Carey married on May 28, 2006. Unfortunately, after 11 years of marriage, the couple divorced.&nbsp;They divorced in November 2017, however, the actual date of divorce is July 31, 2017. Hader filed for divorce in December 2017, and the divorce was finally completed in March 2018.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/bill-hader-and-Maggie-Carey-1.jpg alt="bill hader and Maggie Carey" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>They struck an agreement, and their single status was reinstated on June 23, 2018. Hader and Carey’s 11-year marriage resulted in three children.&nbsp;Hader and Carey revealed their pregnancy for the first time in August 2009. Hannah, her first of three children, was born on October 6, 2009. Three years later, the It: Chapter 2 actor announced the birth of his second daughter. Harper was born to the couple on July 28, 2012.&nbsp;The Hader family was completed two and a half years later with the birth of the actor’s third child, Hayley. Hayley was born on November 15, 2014.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>She’s here!

He used to fawn over them in interviews and tell everyone how much he adored them. Hader even quit Saturday Night Live (SNL) after the birth of his second daughter to be with his family. He was “so obsessed with work and worry” since his job was hard.<br>It came down to being on SNL or becoming a parent. He chose the latter, leaving SNL to spend time with his children and assist his daughter.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Bill-Hader-Daughter-1.jpg alt="Bill Hader Daughter" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>But, as time passed, he became preoccupied with his professional job. He was so preoccupied with filing and filming that he didn’t have time to spend with his family.&nbsp;In a January 2019 interview with Variety, Hader said that he had become an absent parent. He revealed that he had barely spent five days with his children over the summer of 2018.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Bill-Hader-2.jpg alt="Bill Hader" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>He talked up about how difficult it was for him to spend less time with his girls, filled with humiliation. As a result, he said that he will “take off” in the summer of 2019.&nbsp;He sobbed as he spoke about his girls and how much he missed them. Then he blamed his job for his inability to spend time with his children.&nbsp;“It’s this strange thing where when you’re in this field, you don’t have time to be with them, and it’s very, really tough,” he said. As a result, Hader solely accepted writing gigs, as he had said. As a consequence, he was able to work from home and spend time with his children.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiZoqScYrWisMSrZJykn6iypXnBqKWdZaeewal5x56pZpyRqrSpwMSrZg%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./the-mushkin-source-sata-ssd-review.html>&#171;&nbsp;Conclusion: Cheap, But Don't Fill It</a>
