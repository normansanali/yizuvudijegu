On the surface, these two shows seem to have very little in common, but the hilarious&nbsp;Friends reference that was made on&nbsp;Lizzie McGuire is certainly&nbsp;worth looking at.</p><p>Let’s take a look at how&nbsp;Lizzie McGuire&nbsp;referenced&nbsp;Friends.</p><h2 id=friends-is-one-of-the-biggest-shows-ever>‘Friends’ Is One Of The Biggest Shows Ever</h2><p>Debuting back in September of 1994,&nbsp;Friends is a series that has been ingrained in the mainstream consciousness for nearly 30 years. The series, which tabbed 6 fantastic actors for its lead roles, was an instant success on the small screen, and since then, its legend has only continued to grow in the entertainment industry.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The format of this show had been done before, but&nbsp;Friends had the perfect balance that mainstream audiences were looking for back in the 90s. The writing was sharp, the acting was hilarious, and the chemistry between the leads made the show simply irresistible to millions of people each week. Considering that the series stood out in a decade that featured shows like&nbsp;Seinfeld and&nbsp;The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, it makes sense that it has continued to thrive on streaming platforms.</p><p>As new generations continue to be introduced to the show, the legacy of&nbsp;Friends continues to grow each year. The recent reunion was a huge success, and social media couldn’t stop talking about it. Not all of it was great, particularly James Corden being the host of it, but the chatter that arose from the reunion of cast members from a show that is nearly 30 years old is simply tremendous.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Given that the show has been a crowning achievement, it makes sense that many other shows would make references for fans to catch.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fans Are Upset Hilary Duff Will Star In 'How I Met Your Mother' Spinoff Instead Of 'Lizzie McGuire' Reboot</a></span></p><h2 id=many-shows-have-referenced-it>Many Shows Have Referenced It</h2><p>A quick way to generate some buzz and to get the interest of fans is to make a reference to another popular series. It adds an interesting layer to any show, and it can sometimes make for a fun piece of trivia.&nbsp;Friends, naturally, has been a show that many others have referenced a time or two. Usually, the shows are for older audiences, but there have been shows for younger people that have gotten in on the action, as well.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>How I Met Your Mother was a show that made a&nbsp;Friends reference, and the genius part of this was that the&nbsp;reference in question just happened to be tackling one of the most iconic lines in&nbsp;Friends history. In&nbsp;How I Met Your Mother, Lily makes a lobster reference, which was directly related to Phoebe letting Rachel know that Ross is her lobster. Not so subtle, but&nbsp;Friends fans certainly appreciated it.</p><p>A more recent example of a show referencing&nbsp;Friends is&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Good Place</a>. On the show, Michael says, “I feel like&nbsp;Friends in season 8: out of ideas and forcing Joey and Rachel together even though it made no sense.”</p><p>To take things back a bit, we need to head over to Disney Channel, where one of the biggest shows in network history made a nice&nbsp;Friends reference back when it was still on the air.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Everything Lalaine Has Been Up to Since 'Lizzie McGuire'</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-lizzie-mcguire-reference>The ‘Lizzie McGuire’ Reference</h2><p>Kids in the 2000s undoubtedly remember&nbsp;Lizzie McGuire being one of the most popular kids' shows on television. Disney Channel was red hot at the time, and with other offerings like&nbsp;Even Stevens, the network was hitting one home run after the next.&nbsp;Lizzie McGuire was led by Hilary Duff, and one of her character’s best friends, Gordo, made an awesome reference to&nbsp;Friends in one episode of the show.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">In the scene</a>, Gordo says, “Hey, Monica and Rachel, can we talk about something else besides hair?”</p><p>It was a hilarious moment on the show, and it was a nice reference to&nbsp;Friends and the impact that the lead actresses had on hair in the 90s. Rachel, in particular, spawned an entire hairstyle craze that became a staple of the decade.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Everything The Cast Of 'Friends' Did In The Year Leading Up To The Reunion</a></span></p><p>Kudos to&nbsp;Lizzie McGuire&nbsp;for making a hilarious reference to one of the biggest shows of all time.
