The same goes for lots of sitcoms and TV shows. <a href=#>Kaley Cuoco actually revealed what The Big Bang Theory used to do with the extra food.</a> In addition, she would also reveal that during scenes which involved eating, Cuoco would make it a point to eat less.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"If you ever wanted to know what happens during our ‘dinner’ scenes, here are two videos that show the before and after .

In truth, taking a look at that massive pantry of produce, it does seem like the show uses way too much food and surely, not a lot of it used by the aspiring home cooks.</p><p>A spokesperson for Fox issued a statement, stating that <a href=#>the show works alongside an organization called MEND</a> out of Los Angeles, which donates food, clothing and other resources to low income families in need.</p><p>“We do weekly donations with them and one large donation at the end of the season,” the spokesperson stated.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>15 Surprising Secrets From The Set Of Food Network's MasterChef</a></span></p><p>Top Chef is another show that claims it does not waste any food.

He's a proud family man and in addition, the chef works alongside several charitable causes.</p><p>However, things weren't always easy for the popular TV chef. As a child, <a href=#>he lived in a very abusive setting</a>. "Growing up, my father was less than a perfect role model. I watched how he battled alcoholism and how he became terribly violent with my mum, to the point where she feared for her life."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Every time he got violent, any present that my brother, sisters, or I had given my mum would be smashed, simply because he knew it belonged to her. There were instances when the police were called to take him away; mum was taken to the hospital while we kids were taken to a children's home."</p><p>Despite the rough setting, Ramsay was able to create a better future for not only himself, but those around him.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT - <a href=#>Here's How Gordon Ramsay Feels About His Wife's Cooking</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrGwsdJmnqiqlKS7br7ApqqasV2ZvG7DyK2fZpmcoXq1tMRmnLGsopZ6p7vOnWSmmaOpsrOvx56daA%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./janeane-garofalo-saturday-night-live-career-and-net-worth-2021.html>&#171;&nbsp;What Happened To Janeane Garofalo's Career, And How Much Is She Worth Today?</a>
