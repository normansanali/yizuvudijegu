They are still close with each other but as far as the rest of the world? They like having their personal lives kept personal. Here's what we know about them in 2020.</p><h2 id=mary-kate-has-been-horseback-riding><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Mary-Kate Has Been Horseback Riding</span></h2><p>Mary-Kate Olsen totally loves horses. And more than that? She loves to partake in horseback riding! Horseback riding is not some easy feat for people to do whenever they feel like it. It required diligent training and focus. It requires a lot of balance because if you are not balanced on top of that horse, you will be very likely to fall off. Mary-Kate has been riding horses for years and she still does in 2020.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ashley-is-dating-an-artist-named-louis-eisner><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Ashley Is Dating An Artist Named&nbsp;Louis Eisner</span></h2><p>Ashley Olsen is currently in a relationship with Louis Eisner. He is an artist and the two have been dating for a couple of years now. They seem to be very happy together despite the fact that she hasn't really discussed him or the relationship to any public news outlets since the relationship began. Her fans have to do a lot of guessing and speculating when it comes to her romance.</p><h2 id=mary-kate-filed-for-divorce-from-french-banker-olivier-sarkozy><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Mary-Kate Filed For Divorce From French Banker Olivier Sarkozy</span></h2><p>At the start of the pandemic, Mary-Kate Olsen had to file for an emergency <a href=#>divorce order from Olivier Sarkozy</a>, the French banker she was married to for the last five years.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>The Real Reason Behind The Mary-Kate Olsen- Olivier Sarkozy Divorce</a></span></p><p>She cited in her letter that she feared losing her home and belongings to him as he was trying to give her the boot in the middle of the pandemic.

They are not new to walking Met Gala red carpets... this is something they have done for several years. Before the pandemic fully took over and caused everything to close down or get canceled, the sisters had the opportunity to show off another fashionable look for the cameras on the red carpet. The Met Gala is known for being the most high-end fashion event of the year.</p><h2 id=both-sisters-turned-34-years-old-in-2020><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Both Sisters Turned 34 Years Old In 2020</span></h2><p>In 2020, Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen celebrated their 34th birthdays. They were both born on&nbsp;June 13, 1986! According to astrological charts, that means the two sisters are Geminis.

But this is the way we chose to move forward in our lives: to not be in the spotlight, to really have something that speaks for itself.â If they did ever choose to return to acting, it would be so much fun to see them in a new movie or TV show.</p><h2 id=both-sisters-are-still-avoiding-social-media><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Both Sisters Are Still Avoiding Social Media</span></h2><p>Both Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen are still completely off of all social media platforms. That is right... they are not on Instagram, TikTok, Twitter, or any social media platform. It is a bummer that Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen prefer not to use social media because keeping up with them in that manner would be awesome for their fans.
