How old is she? What does she do for a living? Find answers to these questions as you scroll down below.</p><p>We attempt to cover it all here.</p><h3><strong>Meet Alina Dawood, Shahzada Dawood Daughter</strong></h3><p>Late Pakistani-British businessman Shahzada Dawood was a father of two children. The family of four included his wife and his two children <a href=#>Suleman</a> and Alina Dawood. Sadly, Shahzada and Suleman were two of the five missing individuals who were on board the Titanic-bound <span>submersible. Passengers paid OceanGate up to $250,000 to see the remains up close.</span></p><p><span>The Titan set off from St. John’s on the coast of Newfoundland on 16 June 2023. The sub was planned to go 370 miles from the harbor to the Atlantic, where the Titanic is thought to be submerged at a depth of 12,500 feet. Billionaire explorer Hamish Harding informed his buddy and former NASA astronaut Col. Terry Virts of bad weather one day before the launch in a message. &nbsp;</span></p><p>According to Hamish’s article, the Titan’s crew intended to begin the Titan’s drop to the disaster at 4 a.m. ET on Sunday. The US Coast Guard, however, ultimately discovered that the two-hour dive actually began around 8 a.m. Around 9:45 a.m., the submersible lost contact with its surface ship, the Polar Prince, according to the Coast Guard.</p><p>A submersible, unlike a submarine, needs its mothership to launch and surface. The Titan lost contact, effectively becoming lost with no method to determine its own whereabouts.</p><p>Family and friends sent their prayers to the departed souls and grieving family members that included Alina. Several reports suggested that Alina allegedly opened up about her brother’s death stating that Suleman did not want to go on the submersible but he did it to make their father happy on Father’s Day.</p><p>As for her brother Suleman, he was 19 years old. Suleman (Sulaiman) had just finished his first year at the university’s business school at the University of Strathclyde in Glasgow. Reportedly, he just received his diploma from Surrey’s ACS International School Cobham.</p><p>The university’s principal and vice-chancellor, Prof Sir Jim McDonald, wrote to students to inform them that Suleman was in the missing sub. <span>In the message, Prof. McDonald said: “I write to you with a heavy heart to share the news that one of our students, Suleman Dawood, is a passenger on board the submersible that is missing in the North Atlantic. </span><span>I know you will join me in sending our thoughts and prayers to their families and loved ones.”</span></p><h3><strong>Who Is Alina Dawood Mother?</strong></h3><p>Alina Dawood’s mother is called <a href=#>Christine Dawood</a>. Christine was born in Germany in June 1975 (48 years old) and is a graduate of Harvard University. She has built a career as an “Organisational Psychologist, Executive Coach, and Agent for Change” with a professional experience of 20 years. She has worked across a range of sectors, including retail, textiles, engineering, agriculture, consultancy, mental health, training and development, and change management.</p><p>Christine is the founder and CEO of Next Step Now Ltd since 2018. She has also been working as a Member of the Board of Trustees of The Dawood Foundation. She has also worked in companies such as Karstadt, Raumausstattung Neuman, and founded and ran Imhotep Organics Pte Ltd from 2004 to 2010.</p><p>Christine attended <span aria-hidden=true><span aria-hidden=true>FOS/BOS Rosenheim (Mechanical Engineering), </span></span><span aria-hidden=true><span aria-hidden=true>Reutlingen University (Textile Sciences, Engineering, and Management), </span></span><span aria-hidden=true><span aria-hidden=true>HEC Paris (MS in Consulting & Coaching), </span></span><span aria-hidden=true><span aria-hidden=true>Kingston University (Msc in <span class="t-14 t-normal">Occupational & Business psychology</span>), and </span></span><span>Saïd Business School, the University of Oxford (<span class="t-14 t-normal"><span aria-hidden=true>Master’s degree, Consulting and Coaching for Change</span></span>).</span></p><p>The Dawood family shared a statement with the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Independent</a>, saying: “As of now, contact has been lost with their submersible craft and there is limited information available. We are very grateful for the concern being shown by our colleagues and friends and would like to request everyone to pray for their safety while granting the family privacy at this time. The family is well looked after and are praying to Allah for the safe return of their family members.”</p><p>In a new statement seen by the BBC, the family described Mr. Dawood as “a loving father”.</p><p>The statement said: “Shahzada is a loving father to Suleman and Alina, husband to Christine, brother to three siblings, and son to Hussain & Kulsum Dawood. Shahzada has been actively advocating a culture of learning, sustainability, and diversity in his capacity as Vice Chairman of Pakistan’s Engro Corporation. Passionate about social impact, he works extensively with the Engro Foundation, The Dawood Foundation, the SETI Institute, and Prince’s Trust International.”</p><h3><strong>Alina Dawood Age</strong></h3><p>According to <a href=#>Mirror.co.uk</a>, Alinda Dawood is 17 years old as of 2023.</p><h3><strong>Alina Dawood Job</strong></h3><p>Alina Dawood is reportedly attending ACS International Schools.</p><p>On 21 June 2023, ACS International School tweeted, “The ACS International Schools community is deeply concerned by the news that recent ACS Cobham graduate, Suleman Dawood, and his father are on board the submersible which has gone missing during a dive to the Titanic’s wreck. Our thoughts are with the Dawood family and friends.”</p><h3><strong>Is Alina Dawood Dating Anyone?</strong></h3><p>The dating status of Alina Dawood is not available at this moment.</p><h3><strong>Related FAQs</strong></h3><ul><li><h4><strong>When Is Alina Dawood Birthday?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>As of this writing, Alina Dawood’s birthday is not available.</p><ul><li><h4><strong>Where Does Alina Dawood Reside?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Alina Dawoos is currently residing in Surbiton, southwest London.</p><ul><li><h4><strong>Is Alina Dawood On Instagram And Facebook?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Alina Dawood’s social media is not available.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifn6jAqrzNnq%2BtnJ%2Bkv2%2BvzqZmmqSZo65usMCwpqicXZe2sHnAoJxmop%2BXerS0wKGxmpyRYrGiw86om2ackaq0qcDEq2Y%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./783442-al-roker-net-worth.html>&#171;&nbsp;Al Roker Net Worth 2024: What Is The Iconic Weatherman Worth?</a>
