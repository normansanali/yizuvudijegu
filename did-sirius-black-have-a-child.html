Mainly for his best friends but still. One of the greatest loves came not from his connection to James Potter but rather with his relationship to <b>Remus Lupin</b>. The two had an interesting dynamic and one that fans seemed to gravitate towards.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-is-sirius-blacks-son></span>Who is Sirius Black’s son?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Harry After leaving school, Sirius fought against Voldemort, eventually joining the Order of the Phoenix. He remained close friends with James and eventually attended James and Lily Evans’ (now Lily Potter) wedding as their best man. When their son, <b>Harry</b>, was born, Lily and James named Sirius as Harry’s godfather.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-is-sirius-blacks-daughter></span>Who is Sirius Black’s daughter?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><b>Emily Black</b> is Sirius Black’s daughter.

Pottermore does state in Lupin’s profile that Sirius “always got the women”. Sirius is a very handsome, one of the best in the school at everything, best friends with James Potter, and a courageous and witty young man.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=why-did-sirius-get-disowned></span>Why did Sirius get disowned?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>The most famous of these members, of course, was Harry’s godfather Sirius Black, who barely made it to adulthood before he was disowned by <b>the family for rejecting the Blacks’ pure-blood ideals and running away from home</b>.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=was-marlene-mckinnon-married></span>Was Marlene McKinnon married?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Marlene’s four brothers are all wizards as well.

We never witnessed their first meeting; we never saw them slowly but surely falling for one another during Order of the Phoenix missions; nor did we see their eventual wedding – or their deaths.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-is-harry-potters-godmother></span>Who is Harry Potter’s godmother?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>J. K. Rowling once stated in an interview that <b>Harry never had a godmother</b>. This was due to the secrecy and danger in which the Potters had to live. They kept his christening very low-key and did not appoint any godparent except Sirius. Harry only had Sirius.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-mary-macdonald-a-pureblood></span>Is Mary Macdonald a pureblood?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Mary is <b>a Pure-blood witch</b> born on September 16, 1959.

Remus also earned the nickname ‘Moony’ on account of his lycanthropy.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-rita-skeeter-an-animagus></span>Is Rita Skeeter an Animagus?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>The sensationalist Daily Prophet reporter whom Dumbledore had banned from Hogwarts grounds managed somehow to wheedle her way back in by changing into her <b>illegal Animagus</b> form: that of a nasty little beetle.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DAxJyfaKCfrHq1u46doJ1lo56%2FqsHSZpmlmZOgeqmt1Z5kmmWTnbatsI4%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./justin-biebers-controvertial-father-jeremy-relationship-with-daughter-in-law-hailey.html>&#171;&nbsp;Does Justin Bieber's Father Have Anything To Do With Hailey?
