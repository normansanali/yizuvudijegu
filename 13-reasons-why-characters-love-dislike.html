She is a strong survivor and she spoke up in a courtroom full of other people, even though it was extremely hard for her to do that.

He was remorseful.</p><h2 id=we-love-tyler-because-he-s-a-strong-survivor><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>We Love Tyler Because He's A Strong Survivor</span></h2><p class=p1>We love Tyler because just like Jessica, he is another strong survivor.

Yes, he stole the encouragement notes from her classroom box but after that, they were able to develop a healthy and strong friendship where he was there for her.

At the same time, we also don’t like the fact that Hannah decided to end her own life. She decided to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">end her own life</a> based on temporary circumstances.
