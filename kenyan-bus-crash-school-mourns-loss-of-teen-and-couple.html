College was organising another volunteer mission trip to Kenya she had no hesitation about joining.</p><p>"She saw the opportunity and put her hand up,'' one of the school's teachers, Linda Anderson, said.</p><p>"She was always thinking about others and how she could better their circumstances.''</p><p>But it was to be a trip that would ultimately cost Caitlin her life.</p><span class=ad__heading

former Bethlehem student and for Tauranga couple Brian and Grace Johnston after they died when their dream trip turned to tragedy on a rain-soaked Kenyan road.</p><p>The driver of the mini-van they were in lost control in heavy rain.</p><p>The vehicle rolled and ran into a ditch on Kenya's notorious Nairobi-Murang'a highway at 11pm on Tuesday.</p><p>The trio were part of the Bethlehem College mission partnership programme with Kenya's Ark Quest School in Mahanga, and among a group of 12 students from the school, accompanied by seven adults.</p><span class=ad__heading

nothing, but through our visits and financial support, we've managed to build a strong network and helped kids top the league tables with their school results,'' said Bethlehem principal Eoin Crosbie.</p><p>The group left New Zealand on December 28 for a four-week volunteer project building classrooms for the impoverished school.</p><p>They were just days away from returning home.</p><p>The tragedy has left their families and the Bethlehem school community in mourning.</p><p>Mrs Anderson, Bethlehem's head of drama, said Caitlin got so much out of her experiences in Kenya in 2011 that she wanted to return.</p><p>She remembered Caitlin as having a lovely personality and someone who enjoyed helping people in need, including shaving her head to raise money for the teenage cancer support charity CanTeen.</p><p>Caitlin's first trip to Kenya was as a college senior student.</p><p>This time the trip was on her own account.</p><p>Mrs Anderson also had fond memories of Caitlin's enthusiasm as a drama student.</p><p>"She loved Shakespeare. She was the queen who reigned over a Shakespeare competition at school.

They are a brilliant bunch. I'm sure it will be a very low-key barbecue this Saturday,'' Ms Allen said.</p><p>On Caitlin's Facebook page, friends paid tributes last night.</p><p>On a photograph of the former student a friend had written "you have to be an angel''.</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p>Laurence Matthew Dean posted: "I refuse to believe that I will ever meet a woman with such a staggering zest for life as you.</p><p>"You loved unconditionally, your dorky sense of humour was infectious, you were everything we could have asked for and more. We will miss you more than you could possibly know. You will never be forgotten. I love you Caitlin Dickson, always.''</p><p>The Johnstons, who had 10 children, were heavily involved in the college and would attend most school events or functions. "Even if their children weren't in them, they would still go along to support the others,'' Mr Crosbie said.</p><p>All 10 of their children attended Bethlehem College, where two are still students.</p><p>"This will touch many people in the community. They were people who served others first as part of their Christian faith,'' Mr Crosbie said.</p><p>Yesterday was the anniversary of Dr Johnston, an anaesthetist, starting with the Bay of Plenty District Health Board.

The van driver, who was considered a member of the mission, also died.</p><p>One teacher, Gemma Tong, was from Rotorua's Chapman College, which is modelled on Bethlehem.</p><p>It was yet to be confirmed whether those who did not survive died at the crash scene or later in hospital.</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p>The tragedy was reported in Kenyan newspaper The Star.</p><p>Murang'a South traffic boss Loise Gatimu told the newspaper the road where the crash happened was notorious for bad driving.</p><p>Most accidents in the region had been caused by careless drivers.</p><p>"We are losing too many innocent lives on this road that has turned into a nightmare to residents due to careless driving. The rising carnage can only be checked if drivers observe traffic rules.''</p><p>A Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade spokesperson said the ministry was aware of a motor vehicle accident in Kenya involving students from Bethlehem College in Tauranga.</p><p>"The New Zealand High Commission in Pretoria is providing consular assistance and support.
