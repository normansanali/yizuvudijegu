James Corden</h1><div id=sub-header>September 2024 · 5 minute read</div><div class=entry-content><p>Charlotte Corden is the youngest daughter of James Corden, an English comedian, actor, writer, and television personality.&nbsp;</p><p>Charlotte’s father is well known for hosting the Late Late Show with James Corden, a discussion show that has been broadcast on CBS since 2015.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The Accidental Birth Of Charlotte</h2><p>Charlotte was born to Corden and his partner Julia Carey.&nbsp;</p><p>In an interview, James Corden revealed that the birth of Charlotte came as a surprise.&nbsp;</p><p>Corden continued that having Charlotte was much more than he and his wife could have imagined.&nbsp;</p><p>Charlotte’s delivery occurred a little bit sooner than anticipated. James and Julia were somewhat surprised when Charlotte was born.&nbsp;</p><p>Charlotte wasn’t scheduled to come for another couple of weeks.&nbsp;</p><p>The Hillingdon-born broadcaster had initially gone for a routine check-up with his then-pregnant wife, but the doctors informed the host and his then-pregnant wife that they might be having their third child shortly.</p><p>Although James and his wife, a former TV producer, have three children, including Charlotte, they are pretty private about their personal lives.</p><p>The Late Late Show host doesn’t post any pictures of his kids on social media, although he has occasionally expressed how things are going with them.&nbsp;</p><p>The paternal ancestry of Charlotte Corden, born in December 2017, originates in Uttoxeter, Staffordshire, England.&nbsp;</p><p>When James found out his wife was giving birth, he was ready to start hosting the talk show The Late Late Show With James Corden.&nbsp;</p><p>He immediately got in touch with pop singer Harry Styles to take over hosting duties for the show.&nbsp;</p><p>Charlotte joined her older brother Max and older sister Carey after birth.</p><p>&nbsp;Max, her sibling, was born in March 2011. Paul McCartney, a founding Beatles member, gave him his first and middle name.</p><p>Carey Corden, her older sister, was born on October 27, 2014. She was given the same name as Julia’s mother.&nbsp;</p><p>Just before the former and his family relocated from the UK to the US so that he could launch The Late Late Show, James and Julia welcomed Carey.&nbsp;</p><p>Cedric Kimberley “Kim” Corden, a musician and the son of Thomas Edward Corden and May Wheeldon, is her paternal great-grandfather.&nbsp;</p><p>Cedric, the great-grandfather of Charlotte, was born in Uttoxeter, Staffordshire.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The Story Behind Charlotte Corden’s Name</h2><p>The now 4-year-old Charlotte almost had the name of a well-known Grammy-winning musician, Beyonce, because of her early delivery.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vizaca.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Charlotte-Corden-1.jpg><p><strong>‘We still haven’t decided on a name for her yet,’</strong> Corden remarked while recalling the moment he almost named his daughter Beyonce in a People interview from December 2017.</p><p><strong>&nbsp;‘I was crying, my wife was crying uncontrollably, the baby was crying, and the doctor inquired about a name after the baby was born. We’re going to call her Beyoncé,’</strong> I said, <strong>‘looking at the doctor for some reason. That was not amusing in my wife’s opinion.’</strong></p><p>Charlotte’s father claims the nurse started filling out papers with Queen Bey’s name despite Charlotte’s father’s claim that she only said the name on a whim.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Relationship between Chorlette And Her Father</h2><p>The now-43-year-old Englishman also said that it seemed wrong and dreadful of him to consider wrapping up the program that day when his wife was eight and a half months pregnant, and the doctor was discussing critical issues regarding childbirth with her.</p><p>James understandably felt the urge to be at her side and immediately left his job to hurry to the delivery room, where Julia gave birth to their third child, Charlotte.&nbsp;</p><p>James Corden, a celebrity actor, acknowledges that having three young children has been a nightmare,</p><p>&nbsp;James has frequently made jokes about how much of a burden having three children was.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Charlotte’s Father- James Corden</h2><p>James Corden was born on August 22, 1978, in Hillingdon, London, England. He is the son of Margaret and Malcolm Corden.</p><p>James Corden is a British actor, comedian, writer, and producer.
