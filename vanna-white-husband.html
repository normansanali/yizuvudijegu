She has held this role since the show’s inception in 1982. While still in school, she began her career as a model by entering Miss Georgia USA in 1978.</p><p>She has written her autobiography, Vanna Speaks (1987), and has made numerous other film and television appearances, including as herself or as a minor character, in addition to her work on Wheel of Fortune. She is also a patron of St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital, an investor in real estate, and the owner of the yarn company Vanna’s Choice.</p><h2>Who is Vanna White Ex-Husband?</h2><p><strong>Vanna may seem uninterested in tying the knot with John right now, but she was actually married to George Santo Pietro for a decade, from 1990 to 2002.</strong> Nikko, 28, and Gigi, 25, are the children of the former couple. While they have not publicly discussed their relationship, Vanna did announce her pregnancy during a 1992 episode of the puzzle show Wheel; unfortunately, she had a miscarriage shortly afterward.</p><p>It was sad to lose the baby so soon after making the announcement. She remarked, “The good news is that I became pregnant again and gave birth to two healthy, beautiful children.” “But there’s no silver lining to the loss of a child.”</p><p><strong>You can also read other celebrities’ husband details we have covered:</strong></p><h2>Who did Vanna Start Dating After Her Divorce from George?</h2><p>Vanna had at least two additional planned nuptials in addition to her wedding to George. John Gibson, a dancer and actor, proposed to her in the 1980s. John’s death in a plane crash in May of 1986 was a terrible loss to the world. In the aforementioned, she discussed how the show’s viewers have shared their own comparable experiences with her. I was comforted by the stories of those who had also suffered the sudden death of a loved one in an accident. She reflected, “I didn’t feel isolated.”</p><p>Vanna started dating Michael Kaye, a businessman, after her divorce from George. The couple became engaged in 2004, but they never married and later broke up. It was only a matter of time before she found true love with her present beau.</p><h2>Vanna White has been in a Relationship with John Donaldson</h2><p>Vanna and John have been dating since 2012, and it’s obvious they’re perfect for each other.
