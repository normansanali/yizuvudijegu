However, she is only in her early 20s. She seems to have been working steadily for a long time, though. According to her Instagram bio, she teaches Pilates at various studios in Los Angeles including Mighty Pilates LA, The Pilates Class Studio, and Heated Room.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Taylor's salary is unknown. It's possible that, like many workout teachers, she is paid per class rather than a monthly or annual salary. But, since she has an Instagram following of almost 50,000 people, she could be earning money from her social media presence.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/kelsi-taylor.jpg><p>According to Yahoo!

Pamela Reif has 6 million followers, which allows her to charge $46,050.55 for a post.</p><p>Kayla Itsines, for example, has 12.6 million followers and makes $60,615.80 when she posts. In contrast, someone like Taylor who has 50,000 followers might be able to charge a few thousand dollars for a post.

From the recent photos that Taylor has posted on her Instagram, she seems to only have great memories of their wedding day, and she cares a lot about her husband.
