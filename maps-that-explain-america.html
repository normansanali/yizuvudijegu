We’d like to change that.

While they did declare DOMA unconstitutional, the Supreme Court still left the decision of permitting or banning gay marriage up to individual states. As of this writing, 37 states allow gay marriage, with groups challenging marriage restrictions in the states that haven't adopted more inclusive marriage laws.</span><h2 class=title>Meth Labs By County</h2><img alt="Meth Labs By County" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/meth-labs-by-county.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class=caption-body>Once a relatively obscure drug associated with biker gangs, methamphetamine has become one of the most popular drugs in America thanks to its relatively easy and cheap production.

African and African American ancestry is most common in the once slave-holding South, just as Mexican heritage in Texas transcends annexation and war.</span><h2 class=title>Countries That Use The Imperial System</h2><img alt="Metric System" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/metric-system.png> <span class=caption-body>As of 2015, only three countries continue to eschew the metric system in favor of the Imperial system: Burma, Liberia, and the United States.</span> <img alt="Size Of Alaska" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/size-of-alaska.png> <span class=caption-body>In the standard Mercator projection map, Alaska is shown to be comparable to Texas in terms of size.

Mexico is a major US heroin supplier as well as the largest foreign supplier of methamphetamine and marijuana. In fact, production of these drugs has only increased since Mexico launched its own War on Drugs in 2005. Currently, the drug trade employs approximately 500,000 people and contributes around $30 billion a year to the Mexican economy.</span><h2 class=title>The Happiest States In The United States</h2><img alt="Happiest States In The United States" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/happiest-states-in-the-united-states.png><h2 class=title>America Visualized By Distance To The Nearest McDonald's</h2><img alt="America Map By McDonalds Locations" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/america-map-by-mcdonalds-locations.jpg> <span class=caption-body>In many ways, McDonald's has become the face of America both home and abroad.

The Economist calls Illinois’ Fourth Congressional District one of the most strangely drawn gerrymandered districts in the country. Crammed into these two tiny swaths of land are a vast amount of left-leaning Latinos, which effectively ensures that they will only have one representative in Congress and consequently cannot sway other races in the city.</span><h2 class=title>The Most Popular Website By State</h2><img alt="Most Popular Website By State" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/most-popular-website-by-state.jpg> <span class=caption-body>Regional differences don't only mean culinary and linguistic distinctions, but also differences in media consumption, in part due to local employment sectors.
