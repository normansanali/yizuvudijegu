He then tried his best to impress her, and fortunately, his efforts were acknowledged. According to Steph, she loved how Leroy could make her smile. No wonder, she chose to spend quite a bit of time with him during the party and even asked him for a date the next day.</span></p><p><span>Naturally, the two grew close and Steph got to understand Leroy’s emotional side as well. However, even though she knew Leroy was exactly the man she wanted, she was afraid to rush things because she had been hurt in the past.</span></p><p><span>As the season progressed, Steph then went on to build another connection with Quentin Marquis Lloyd. Quentin was also quite affectioned and seemed to understand Steph’s issues — making Steph wonder if Leroy was the correct choice.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Furthermore, Steph even went to reveal Steven (her son) to Quentin. Obviously, this made Leroy very angry! He felt betrayed and lied to.</span></p><p><span>The two then went through a minor scuffle before parching up again.</span></p><p><span>Then came Steph’s father who disapproved of Leroy but stayed quiet for the sake of her daughter.</span></p><p><span>But what’s not meant to happen will never happen. During the last ep, Steph confessed she wasn’t ready for a relationship and broke things off with Leroy.</span></p><p><span>In case you’re interested, Steph Michaels is an actress, singer, creative, and someone who is vegan and into holistic health and nutrition.
