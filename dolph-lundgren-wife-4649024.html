Throughout his career, he’s dabbled in directing, and he’s taken on plenty of big roles, including He-Man in the Masters of the Universe movie and returning to the big screen for the all-star cast of&nbsp;The Expendables. Most recently, he played King Nereus in 2018’s Aquaman and 2023’s The Best Man.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>More recently, Dolph made headlines after confirming he <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>married his much-younger fiancée</a>, <strong><a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Emma Krokdal</a></strong>, 25, on July 13, 2023 in Greece. “We chose to celebrate our love by getting married at our villa in Mykonos with family and a few close friends,’ the cute couple told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>People </a>at the time. “With both Covid and a long road of challenging medical treatments, we’ve had to push our marriage plans many times. We felt it was finally the right time to celebrate love, life and happiness— in the land of the Gods.” Emma is not Dolph’s first bride. Learn about all three of his marriages, below.</p><h2>Peri Momm</h2><p id=content-paragraph-6>Before the success of Rocky IV, Dolph was already mingling with stars as he worked on getting a master’s degree in chemical engineering. He opened up about his fling with singer <strong>Grace Jones&nbsp;</strong>during the 1980s in a Nov. 2018 interview with <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Irish Times</a>. Shortly after hitting it off with Grace, he was cast Drago, and it jumpstarted his career. “To give up that scholarship and become a starving actor? It was insane when I think back. But I had this feeling that I didn’t want to be a chemical engineer. That it wasn’t going to be enough for me,” he recalled. “I’ll run into some of my old friends or I’ll visit my old school and talk to the students. I’ll wonder what my life would have been like. I would have had less physical injuries, for sure.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Dolph and Grace’s relationship eventually ended, and he married <strong>Peri Momm</strong> in 1991 once he was already a big name in Hollywood. They kept their marriage very private and it only lasted a year. It is not known what Peri is up to now, as she has stayed away from the limelight during and after her romance with the Universal Soldier actor.</p><h2>Anette Qviberg</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Dolph-Lundgren-family-ss-embed2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-8>The longer of Dolph’s two marriages came in 1994, when he wed interior designer&nbsp;<strong>Anette Qviberg</strong>. Like Dolph’s first ex, Anette prefers to keep her life on the private side. It is known they <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>share two daughters</a>: The pair’s older daughter <strong>Ida,&nbsp;</strong>was born in 1996, is an actress who made her first appearance in the 2009 movie command performance, which her dad directed. She worked with her dad again in the 2021 flick Castle Falls,&nbsp;per <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>IMDb</a>. She’s also a model and several professional shots of her can be viewed on her <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a> feed. Dolph and Anette’s secondborn daughter, <strong>Greta</strong>, was born a few years later in 2001 (according to her <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a>) and seems to be an aspiring photographer and has an <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a> dedicated to her work.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>After over 15 years of marriage, Dolph and Anette split up in 2011. While Anette mostly stayed out of the spotlight both before and after their marriage, she did make headlines when their house got broken into by burglars in May 2009. Dolph spoke about the experience in a 2010 interview with <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>talkSport.</a>&nbsp;He revealed that the robbers left upon realizing whose family they were robbing. “They saw some pictures, and they gave my wife… a few things back, and then they took off,” he said. “It was a bad experience, and I sent a few friends of mine from Bulgaria to try to find these guys and have a talk to them, but nothing worked. We never found them.”</p><h2>Emma Krokdal</h2><p id=content-paragraph-12>After his split from Anette, Dolph had a six-year relationship with actress and makeup artist <strong>Jenny Sandersson</strong>, but they broke up in 2017. Dolph then met Norwegian trainer <strong>Emma Krokdal</strong>, 25, in 2019, and the pair got engaged in June 2020. Emma admitted to not really knowing any of Dolph’s movies before they met in a <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>January 2021 interview.</a> The Johnny Mnemonic actor announced that the pair were engaged in an<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> Instagram post</a> shared on June 16, 2020. “Something very special happened here in Sweden,” he wrote in the caption accompanying a photo of Emma holding up her ring. They’ve been <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>spotted kissing</a> and <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>holding hands</a> while <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>out and about</a> ever since.</p><p id=content-paragraph-13>In his May 2023 interview on In Depth with Graham Bensinger, Dolph called Emma “an angel that was sent down to help” him. He also addressed their age gap. “I feel like Emma is very mature for her age, for sure. She’s had an interesting life. She came over here from a small town in Norway. She was married here and she went through a difficult divorce and went through a lot of stuff that most young people her age don’t have to deal with,” he explained. “So she’s quite mature and at the same time, I think I’m quite youthful. But you know, I’ve been with people that are twice her age [who are] less mature than she is.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8Ooo6mgXaHCr7DGq5ynZaees6Z5k29rcmhiaXw%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./freddie-liu.html>&#171;&nbsp;Freddie Liu Net Worth, Age, Girlfriend, Family, Biography &amp;amp; More</a>
