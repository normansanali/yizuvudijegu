From 1962 through 1983, he was a right-handed pitcher in the Major Leagues for eight different clubs. Perry has 314 wins, 3,534 strikeouts, and a 3.11 ERA over his 22-year baseball career. In 1991, in his third year of eligibility, he was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame.</p><p>Perry, a five-time All-Star, was the first pitcher to win the Cy Young Award in both the American League (1972) and the National League (1978) while playing for the Cleveland Indians and the San Diego Padres, respectively; the announcement of his Cy Young Award came the day after he turned 40, setting a record that would stand for the next 26 years.</p><p>In addition, he and his sibling Jim Perry hold the record for the second-most victories by a brother-and-sibling duo in baseball history (behind only the knuckleball-throwing Niekro brothers, Phil and Joe).</p><p>Perry, a pitcher with the Seattle Mariners, became the 15th player in MLB history to reach 300 victories in 1982.</p><p>To further cement his reputation for doctoring baseballs (e.g., throwing spitballs), Perry titled his 1974 autobiography Me and the Spitter, but he was not dismissed for the unlawful activity until August 23, 1982, during his 21st season in the majors.</p><p>Beginnings and Formative Years Edit</p><p>In honor of a close family friend of his father’s who tragically passed away after having his teeth extracted, Gaylord Perry was born in Williamston, North Carolina.</p><p>Gaylord Perry was born to farmers Evan and Ruby Perry. It was well-known that Evan Perry was a talented sportsman. Gaylord and his family spent their formative years in Williamston and the nearby community of Farmlife in the Township of Griffins in Martin County. Gaylord’s older brother, Jim Perry, and younger sister, Carolyn, also spent their formative years there. Gaylord helped his dad out with the farming on the family farm. Jim and Gaylord both got their start playing baseball with their dad during their lunch breaks on the farm. Years later, the three of them would end up on the same local semi-professional team.</p><p>When Gaylord was in high school, he played three sports at Williamston High: football, basketball, and baseball. Before he quit football, he made All-State as a sophomore and junior on both offense and defense. Although Gaylord didn’t play basketball until his sophomore year, he and Jim led Williamston to the state championship game in his freshman year. Williamston had a 94-8 record throughout Gaylord’s stint there, and he was responsible for over 30 points and 20 rebounds per game. He would decline numerous basketball scholarships at prestigious universities.</p><p>When Perry first joined the Williamston baseball team as a freshman, he played third base, and Jim took the mound. But Gaylord started splitting pitching duties with Jim toward the conclusion of his freshman year. By virtue of the Perry brothers’ two-game sweep of the 1955 North Carolina Class A state finals, Williamston High School emerged victorious. In high school, Gaylord had a record of 33-5.</p><p>It was in his home state that he attended college, at Campbell University.</p><p>Presentational mode</p><p>A Profession</p><p>Following their time in the game</p><h3>Results from the Pitching Staff Edit</h3><p>Perry is one of only six pitchers (along with Pedro Martinez, Roger Clemens, Randy Johnson, Roy Halladay, and Max Scherzer) to win the Cy Young Award in both the American and National League. After Cy Young, he recorded the second-most 15-win seasons in a row (1966–1988) and the most all-time (with 15). (1891–1905). With 17 consecutive wins, Greg Maddux surpassed both of them (1988–2004).</p><h4>Personal life</h4><p>Blanche Manning Perry, Perry’s wife, was killed on U.S. Route 27 in Lake Wales, Florida on September 11, 1987 when another driver disregarded a stop sign and collided with her car head-on.</p><p>There were three daughters and a son born to Perry and Blanche.</p><p>Jack, their son, passed away on June 18th, 2005 from leukemia. Perry’s son Jack played on the first first Limestone College Baseball Team in 1988 when the program was founded in Gaffney, South Carolina.</p><p>For his pitching prowess, Jack was honored with a posthumous induction into the Limestone College Athletics Hall of Fame in 2017.<br>Jack threw two no-hitters in the span of two weeks during the 1990 season, making him the only player in Limestone College history to do so.
