With light and bright colors trending, we aren't seeing much demand for the stained woodwork look.<h2>Is stained trim popular?</h2>Stained wood trim is very common in older homes, and keeping it stained can bring a sense of warmth and rustic charm to a room. Even so, some older homes can still benefit from painting trim.<h2>Should you paint or stain wood trim?</h2>Generally, if wood trim isn't painted already, don't, especially if it's quality stain-grade and historic. But if the condition is sub-par and/or there are natural breaks for the painted vs. not like in a bedroom or distinct built-it, mixed woodwork is a beautiful way to highlight natural wood in a space.<h2>Is wood trim making a comeback?</h2>Home décor trends in 2019 are returning to warm and comfortable styles last seen in the 1990s.

There are several possible reasons for this. First, homeowners are looking for warmth and authenticity in their kitchens. Natural wood checks all the boxes.<h2>Is oak wood trim outdated?</h2>The answer is – no! The oak trim and oak flooring finish (the golden color known in the industry as “honey”) will never come back in style.

White cabinetry and baseboards are being traded for something with more tone or color. So if you have and love your white walls–this trend is for you because it's a great way to add character and color or contrast to your space!<h2>Should all the trim in a house match?</h2>As a general rule, plan to paint all the trim throughout the main areas of the house the same color to create a unified effect from room to room. In more personal spaces, such as bedrooms and bathrooms, you might want to play around with more unique wall and trim color combinations.<h2>Can you have white trim and stained doors?</h2>Yes, you can mix wood and white trim in the same house (or, even, in the same room)! Mixing painted and stained trim is completely doable, as long as you keep these tips in mind.<h2>Should interior doors be painted or stained?</h2>Paint naturally allows a much wider range of colors, and a more predictable color outcome. With stain, the end result varies by the species and wood cut, as well as how it's applied. Factory stain application lends to better consistency across all doors for a project.<h2>Should I replace trim or paint it?</h2>If your trim is showing wear and tear, painting is always an option, but the prep work is important and can be time-intensive. Replacement is your best option if they're water-damaged, stained or warped.<h2>Is white trim still popular?</h2>Simple Baseboards<p>Most baseboards are 3 to 5 inches high and white or ivory is still the go-to painted trim color for most homes.</p><h2>Should I paint my oak trim white?</h2>Painting your oak trim white is a great option too. The trim will absorb some light, brighten up your space and make your room appear bigger, even if it's not.<h2>Does GREY go with wood trim?</h2>Neutral and cool greys and greiges work really well with wood trim to neutralize their warmth- which can sometimes be too much when you have a lot of wood in your space. Grays and greiges will make the space feel much more modern, and if you stay on the light side it will still brighten your space.<h2>Can you mix painted and stained trim?</h2>The good news is that painted trim and stained trim can coexist in the same space. One way to combine stained and painted trim in the same room is to paint the trim a color other than white. You could choose a color for your trim that matches your furnishings and leave the walls white or off-white.<h2>What is the 60 30 10 decorating rule?</h2>It's a classic decor rule that helps create a color palette for a space. It states that 60% of the room should be a dominant color, 30% should be the secondary color or texture and the last 10% should be an accent.<h2>Is GREY paint going out of style?</h2>Navy and gray are on the way out<p>Yes, while gray has seen an uninterrupted reign over recent paint trends, its reign may conclude in 2022. However, this shift is perhaps only expected in the interiors world, as Anthony Barzilay Freund, the editorial director at 1stDibs, explains.</p><h2>Is dark wood a 2021 style?</h2>People are going to embrace lighter woods in 2021.<p>"Whether it's Scandinavian blonde or a more rustic light oak, we're seeing lighter-toned wood replace medium and darker shades," Wood told Insider.</p><h2>Is open concept going out of style 2021?</h2>Is Open Concept out the Door? Having been the go-to trend for so many years, it's unlikely that the open-floor concept will just disappear quietly. Besides the fact that completely undoing an open-floor plan is incredibly costly, things might change back as interior design trends do after a few years.<h2>What is the new decorating trend for 2022?</h2>“2022 is going to be full of round-edged, organically shaped furniture,” Kirsten Conner, principal designer at Kirsten Connor Interior Design, says, and other designers agree. “We are seeing lots of curves in furniture to provide an environment of comfort and calm,” Bartone says.<h2>How do you modernize honey oak trim?</h2>Refresh Your Wall Color to Update your Honey Oak<p>The hallmark of a 90s-style home is the pairing of honey oak with paint colors in shades of brown or red.
