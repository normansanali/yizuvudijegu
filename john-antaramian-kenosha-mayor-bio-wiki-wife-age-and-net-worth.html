Simmons Memorial&nbsp; Library.</p><p>The protesters forced John to relocate his press conference on the shooting from a local park to the city’s public safety building.

But John, would rather he didn’t. John told NPR’s Weekend Edition on August 31, 2020:</p><p>“Realistically, from our perspective, our preference would have been for him not to be coming at this point in time. All presidents are always welcome and campaign issues are always going on. But it would have been, I think, better had he waited to have for another time to come.”</p><p>The White House had earlier announced on August 29, 2020, that Trump will visit Kenosha the following week, as he leans into a law and order message that has emerged as a dominant theme of his reelection bid. The president has publicly denounced&nbsp;the violence in Kenosha.</p><p>He alluded to it at Republican National Convention to accuse his November 2020 rival, Joe Biden, of failing to address “rioters and criminals spreading mayhem in Democrat-run cities. Karen Bass, California Democratic congresswoman sais that Trump’s plan to visit Kenosha has “one purpose and one purpose only and that’s to agitate things.”</p><p>John said:</p><p>”…not the situation, I think, that people perceive — that the people in Kenosha are rioting … they are protesting and absolutely have every right to protest.”</p><p>He said that he has no problem with the peaceful protests-the problem really did come from people coming from outside the area and causing a great deal of damage and destruction. He said that protests in Kenosha had been very peaceful, with a prayer vigil led by Blake’s family just a week after he was shot seven times in front of his three children by a police officer. Blake was left paralyzed from the waist down, sparking the protests.</p><p>The demonstrations turned deadly when a 17-year-old from Illinois allegedly shot and killed two protesters and injured a third. The teen named <strong>Kyle Rittenhouse</strong> was arrested and faced six criminal counts, including homicide.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=john-antaramian-heart-attack></span><span>John Antaramian Heart Attack</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>On May 28, 2019, Kenosha officials announced that John had suffered a heart attack.
