She learned complicated and physically demanding choreographies, which she had to perform flawlessly while not letting her voice quiver. As far as I'm concerned, she earned a long rest.</p><h2 id=taylor-swift-about-the-future-of-the-eras-tour>Taylor Swift About The Future Of The Eras Tour</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"A lot of you are like, 'How are you going to celebrate the 100th show?'" <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Taylor said to the crowd</a> right before announcing some devastating news. "The celebration of the 100th show for me means this is the very first time <strong>I've acknowledged to myself and admitted that this tour is going to end in December</strong>."</p><p>Of course, we were all immediately up in arms. <strong><a href=#>The Eras tour</a> has been our constant companion ever since it started in March last year. We all created rituals around it, and having to let them go will be bittersweet</strong>.</p><p>We spent months waiting eagerly for the surprise songs, begging she wouldn't play our favorite at a show we couldn't attend, coordinating outfits with our friends, and of course, as soon as we got tickets, we spent a lot of time (and money) making friendship bracelets to share with other swifties.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Taylor tried to cheer us up, knowing her announcement had caused most of the crowd to burst into tears. "That feels so far away from now, but then again, it feels like we just played our first show on this tour because you have made this so fun for us," she lovingly said.</p><h2 id=taylor-needs-to-rest-and-we-should-be-mindful-of-that>Taylor Needs To Rest And We Should Be Mindful Of That</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/taylor-swift-eras-tour-1.jpg><p>The tour ending in December is the end of an era (see what I did there?). Trust me, I know it's devastating. But as much as we will miss Taylor Swift's amazing shows, <strong>we need to remember she's human, just like us, and the Eras tour is extremely demanding</strong>.</p><p>By December, Taylor will have spent over a year and a half putting on 2-and-a-half-hour-long shows, and no matter how skilled and eager she is, I can't imagine how exhausted she is.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/1-5.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Taylor Swift's Eras Tour Attracted Many Celebrities, But Not All Of Them Got VIP Treatment">Taylor Swift's Eras Tour Attracted Many Celebrities, But Not All Of Them Got VIP Treatment</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Taylor Swift's tour has had Swifties and celebrities in attendance. Some celebs got the golden ticket to the VIP Tent, but others were not so lucky.</p><p>In addition, as she said herself at her last show, the tour has taken over her life, and she needs to reconnect with other things that make her happy.</p><p>"<strong>It's taken over everything. I think I once had hobbies, but I don't know what they were anymore</strong> because all I do when I'm not on stage is sit at home and try to think of clever acoustic song mashups," she admitted.</p><p>"Just know that I appreciate every single ounce of effort that you've put into being with us when this tour reaches triple digits of shows — so thank you," she concluded her announcement.</p><p>We still have until December to enjoy the Eras tour, and even when it's over, once Taylor has rested properly, we will no doubt get another tour. She has never let us down, so we have to trust that whatever comes next will be just as amazing.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGirmrGcpL9uv9aina1llaeutHnTqKyrZZGju7DBzZycpp2eqXquscCnqmato2Q%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./what-are-slats-on-a-bed-frame.html>&#171;&nbsp;What are slats on a bed frame</a>
