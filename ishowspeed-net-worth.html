He is recognized for his gaming and entertainment live streams, which have gathered more than 1 million subscribers soon.</span></p><p><span>In this article, we will cover the net worth of IShowSpeed, childhood, career, and many more.</span></p><h2>What Is the Net Worth of IShowSpeed?</h2><p><span>According to several estimates, the net worth of IShowSpeed as of 2022 is said to be around $1 million which he has earned majorly from his <a href=# rel=noopener>online YouTube career</a>. He typically makes around $75 to $200 per video and the amount depends upon the video length.</span></p><p><span>IShowSpeed also earned considerable net worth from sponsorships, YouTube ad revenue, and other endeavors.</span></p><p><span>He typically earns $167,000 per month from the YouTube ads alone and makes nearly $2 million yearly from YouTube alone.</span></p><p><span>After taking a dig into his net worth, let’s have a look at IShowSpeed’s childhood development.</span></p><h2>Early Life</h2><p><span>Darren was born on the 29th of January 21, 2005, in Ohio, United States. He spent the majority of his growing years in his birthplace and also has two younger siblings: a brother and a sister. He has been passionate about <a href=# rel=noopener>YouTube and computer games</a> from a very young age. Watkins Jr. attends his sophomore year of high school currently.</span></p><p><span>Before starting his online career, he used to work in a nursing home, working as a food delivery executive for the elderly. Darren didn’t continue his further studies and never enrolled at college as he wanted to pursue his career as a YouTuber, in fact, he didn’t want to attend school as well.&nbsp;</span></p><h2>Online Career</h2><p><span>Darren’s friend encouraged him to be a YouTuber and as a result of this, he started posting videos on YouTube in April 2020 under the name IShowSpeed as he didn’t have anything else to do amidst the coronavirus pandemic.</span></p><p><span>Soon after, Darren left his job in a nursing home in order to pay attention to making content for YouTube. IShowSpeed started <a href=# rel=noopener>gaining followers</a> soon after he started sharing as he was among those individuals streaming quality NBA 2020 and 2021 content.</span></p><p><span>Darren also used to play Talking Tom & Friends, Fortnite, as well as Five Nights at Freddy’s. IshowSpeed’s videos were majorly dependent on his live streams in history. He is also involved in music and rapping. Within a period of almost 2 years, Darren gathered about 9.4 million subscribers.</span></p><p><span>IShowSpeed has earned the most of his net worth from the content he shares on YouTube.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/venturejolt.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/IShowSpeed-Net-Worth.jpg><h2>Controversies</h2><p><span>Sadly, in December 2021, Darren experienced adverse events when he received an invitation from Adin Live’s <a href=# rel=noopener>dating show</a> on Twitch. He made moves over Ash Kaash, a social media influencer.</span></p><p><span>The model stated no to him which enraged him. Thereafter, he didn’t stream for a short period of time and when he made a comeback, he went on to bash Ash with sexist statements. As a result of this, Twitch eventually banned him.</span></p><p><span>In November 2021, Darren released his most popular single named Shake which also led to controversy. He even danced to its controversial lyrics on stream and after that video was seen by his father, he bashed him but this may not be enough for Darren to stop. He went on to show off his moves in his music.&nbsp;</span></p><h2>Personal Life</h2><p><span>There were rumors claiming that he has a daughter whose name he never revealed.&nbsp; He also dated Ermony Renee in the past but the couple split after he found out that she cheated on him.</span></p><p><span>IShowSpeed has put a lot of effort into earning this net worth of $1 million. <a href=# rel=noopener>Stay tuned</a> to our website to get all the latest updates.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiulaPBtr7Eo6alrF6YvK57kWlpa2dgbHxyfI6iqqGnp6i9prHDZqWerF2svLPAx2g%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./jordan-southerland-and-evette-morales-the-dynamic-power-couple-dominating-the-basketball-influencer-world.html>&#171;&nbsp;Jordan Southerland and Evette Morales: The Dynamic Power Couple Dominating the Basketball Influencer</a>
