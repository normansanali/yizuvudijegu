Atlanta, Georgia in the United States of America.</strong></p><p>He was born to Felicia Jones and Lamar Jackson Sr. He shares the same father with his two sisters and his younger brother, Jamar Jackson who he spent most of his time with.</p><p>Lamar Jackson was raised in the heart of a struggling neighborhood in Pompano Beach, Florida. When Jackson was 8 years old, his father passed away from a heart attack on the same day as his grandma in 2005.</p><p>He and his siblings were brought up by their mother. He attended public schools and participated in Pop Warner football with future teammate Marquise Brown in the same Florida league.&nbsp;</p><p>Jackson was able to toss a football 20 yards when he was just 8 years old and he also&nbsp;tossed a football 100 yards in high school. He and his mother are quite close, and she is incredibly proud of how far he has progressed in his football career.</p><p>Jackson thrived as a quarterback at Florida’s Boynton Beach High School. Jackson was a productive read-option quarterback at Boynton Beach who was equally adept at running and throwing the ball.&nbsp;</p><p>He spent hours each week viewing movies to increase his decision-making and passing accuracy. Jackson passed for 2,263 yards, 31 touchdowns, and nine interceptions in two seasons at Boynton Beach.&nbsp;</p><p>Jackson threw two interceptions, and Boynton Beach was brutally trounced 49–6. In one track event, he set a personal record of 11.45 seconds in the 100-meter dash while competing for his high school’s track squad.</p><p>Jackson had a three-star rating from 247Sports and ESPN.com, but a four-star rating from Rivals.com. He earned offers from Power Five colleges including Louisville, Florida, Auburn, and Clemson as well as mid-major programs like Akron, Western Kentucky, and Marshall despite the debate among recruiting firms over his caliber.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=#><strong>READ ALSO: Lamar Jackson Parents: Meet Felicia Jones & Lamar Jackson</strong></a></p><p>Jackson was rated as a top 20 dual-threat quarterback by all of the major recruiting firms, with 247Sports placing him as high as #12. Jackson’s in-state rankings also fluctuated significantly, from #51 on Rivals to #80 on ESPN.</p><p>Jackson participated in 12 games and eight starts as a freshman at Louisville in 2015 (he was a communications major). The Cardinals finished the season 8-5. He ran for 960 yards and 11 rushing touchdowns while completing 135 of 247 throws for 1,840 yards, 12 touchdowns, and eight interceptions.&nbsp;</p><p>Jackson declared his intention to participate in the 2018 NFL Draft on January 5, 2018. Although some draft experts questioned Jackson’s quarterback skills and urged that he switch to the wide receiver position because of his athleticism, he steadfastly vowed to play quarterback professionally.&nbsp;</p><p>Since his first season, Jackson has been largely considered the best running quarterback in the NFL. His two-threat approach to the game has led to numerous Michael Vick analogies. With Jackson at the helm, the Ravens have led the league in running every year until his debut campaign.</p><p>&nbsp;In 2019, the Ravens broke the mark for the most rushing yards by a quarterback in a season, and Jackson broke Vick’s mark for the same. But when the run game is controlled, questions have been raised about his ability to play as a pure pocket passer.</p><p>Although most commentators have noted improvements in his passing skills over time, he is rarely compared to the league’s top passers.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Lamar Jackson Girlfriend: Meet Jamie Taylor</h2><p>Jackson is currently in a relationship with Jamie Taylor. The couple commenced their relationship in 2017 and is still going strong.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Who is Jamie Taylor?</h2><p>Jamie Taylor is a groomer based in Los Angeles. She has collaborated with photographers Annie Leibovitz, Steven Klein, and Richard Burbridge.
