While the full details of what happened next have yet to come out in court, prosecutors have painted a disturbing picture of the events that followed on Christmas morning.</p><p>Wallace reportedly dragged his wife into the living room with sunglasses on her head, propped her body on the couch, and told his kids that “she got drunk and ruined Christmas.” Then, the children began to open their presents, unaware that they were doing so in front of their mother’s corpse.</p><p>But Wallace couldn’t sustain the ruse for long, and by 9:30 a.m., he called 911 and innocently said his wife needed medical attention (though accounts differ as to who called). When paramedics arrived on the scene, her body was still there on the couch, sunglasses on her face.</p><p>Wallace tried to talk his way out of it with a story about his wife accidentally injuring herself, but it didn’t work. Soon, the cops were on the scene and he was under arrest.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-319748 alt="William Wallace Mug Shot" width=900 height=678 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/william-wallace-mug-shot.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-319748 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Orange County Jail</span><span class=caption-body>William Wallace faces up to 25 years to life in prison if convicted of first-degree murder.</span></p><p>The prosecution’s case paints a grim portrait of both what happened on Christmas 2011 and the years of abuse that led up to it.</p><p>“This Christmas story does not have a happy ending, and unfortunately this is not just a story, it is real life,” said Senior Deputy District Attorney Heather Brown.</p><p>In her opening statements, Brown told the jury that Wallace “did what he always did, expecting [Preston] to survive like she always did.” But during this particular beating, Preston succumbed to her wounds while her kids were fast asleep.</p><p>Preston’s family had already informed investigators of how violent and controlling Wallace could be. One of her relatives claimed to have found Preston in the street following a particularly brutal beating while she was pregnant.</p><p>Meanwhile, Wallace’s attorney Heather Moorhead is advancing his story that it was all a tragic accident.</p><p>“Mr. Wallace is being accused of something that is not his fault,” said Moorhead. “You will hear about a relationship that was full of arguing and yelling, but also a lot of love.”</p><p>The defense maintains that Preston drunkenly fell onto a glass table and shattered it. However, police found blood throughout the residence as well as numerous holes in the wall and one door that was off its hinges.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-319749 alt="Za Zell Preston And William Wallace" width=900 height=506 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/za-zell-preston-and-william-wallace.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-319749 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Facebook</span><span class=caption-body>Za’Zell Preston and William Wallace mere months before he killed her.</span></p><p>Furthermore, Preston’s relatives say that Wallace had tried to kill her several times before. Brown told the jury that Wallace himself explained that “we were drinking and during the argument I tossed her around a bit.”</p><p>However, Preston’s older daughter said she saw her mother trip and fall into the glass table before Wallace could catch her. Moorhead said that both Wallace and the daughter carried her into the bathtub, but accidentally hit her head on the way to the bathroom.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>According to The New York Post</a>, it remains unclear who called emergency services. What is apparent, however, is that Wallace told several people that his wife had suffered a concussion after she hit her head — and only realized that she was dead when she failed to wake up the following morning.</p><p>But if the jury doesn’t believe this defense and he’s convicted, Wallace faces up to 25 years to life in prison. He has already been incarcerated since Christmas Day 2011, and remains behind bars on $1 million bail.</p><p>After reading about the California man who propped his dead wife on the couch as his children opened their Christmas gifts, learn about <a href=#>Maurice Jewel Taylor</a>, the father of four who decapitated two of his children and forced the others to live with the corpses.
