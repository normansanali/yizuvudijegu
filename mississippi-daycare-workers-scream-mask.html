I just wanted to say that it is being taken care of.”</p><p>As <a href=# rel=noopener>The Daily Mail</a> reports, Sierra McCandless, who refers to herself as CeeCee, took to Facebook to address the abuse in a 19-minute video.</p><p>McCandless appears in the viral video donning the Ghostface mask, getting within inches of children’s faces, and grabbing children who tried to run away — all of which she said “wasn’t meant to harm anybody and it wasn’t ill-intentioned.”</p><p>“The teachers asked me if I would do it or if they could use [the mask] to get their class to listen or clean up,” she said. “I’m not a child abuser.”</p><p>“I was in complete shock of what I witnessed,” Katelyn Johnson, the mother of a child who attends Lil’ Blessings, told <a href=# rel=noopener>ABC News</a>. “Whether they had a mask on or a mask off, their behavior was unacceptable. My blood pressure was raised. It broke my heart for my child. I was angry.”</p><p>In the video, as McCandless prowls the room scaring the children, the employee filming is heard laughing off-camera.</p><p>“I didn’t go in there with intentions to literally traumatize those children,” McCandless added. She also said that the children reacted in different ways, some crying, others laughing, and a few staring blankly at her.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-404413 alt="L'il Blessings Worker Sierra McCandless" width=900 height=600 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/lil-blessings-worker-ceecee.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-404413 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Facebook</span><span class=caption-body>Sierra “CeeCee” McCandless, the Lil’ Blessings employee seen on video tormenting children in a Ghostface mask.</span></p><p>The mask, she said, was purchased to scare her coworker —&nbsp;not the children.</p><p>“What you all didn’t see was after I had left the room, I took it off and I went back into the classroom,” she continued, “and I said, ‘CeeCee got the monster. It’s not coming back.’ And they would hug me. I’ve known those kids their whole life.”</p><p>She also cited what she claimed to be a similar stunt that took place around Christmas.</p><p>“Last Christmas there were these kids taking Christmas pictures, and they would have the Grinch hiding in the bush over there. And it would come out, scare the kids, and they would run,” she said. “People thought that was funny… Essentially it’s the same thing. It is the same thing.”</p><p>The children, she said, reacted the way they did “because they are children.”</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-404389 alt="Daycare Worker Scaring Child" width=900 height=600 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/daycare-worker-scaring-child.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-404389 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Twitter</span><span class=caption-body>Sierra McCandless, wearing a scary Halloween mask, inches away from a child’s face.</span></p><p>“I want them to see the terror on [my daughter’s] face because that is what I see every night,” Alyssa Hayes, another parent whose child was a victim of the “prank,” told ABC News.</p><p>The employee who filmed the video, Jennifer Kayla Newman, also wrote a <a href=# rel=noopener>post</a> on Facebook explaining why she took the recording.</p><p>“A couple of weeks ago some girls at the daycare bought Halloween masks to scare the kids, they did it and I never got it on video,” she said. “When I heard she was going to do it again, I recorded to get the proof and then the video was sent to parents to show them how their child was being treated… I did not video this for sh*ts and giggles.”</p><p>After the video went viral, local authorities, the County Prosecuting Attorney, and the District Attorney met with the children’s parents to discuss options and informed them of potential criminal charges they could file against the daycare workers.</p><p>“I admit it was very hard to watch these videos,” Sheriff Kevin Crook <a href=# rel=noopener>wrote on Facebook</a>. “It made me sick to my stomach to think of the terror those kids were enduring.”</p><p>Unfortunately, Lil’ Blessings isn’t the first daycare to create an unsafe environment for children.
