The dark story by Richard Gadd has been a major talking point over the last couple of weeks. Gadd has opened up about the experience during various interviews.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One of them came alongside This Morning. Gadd talked about the TV series getting picked up by Netflix, and his thoughts about working alongside Jessica Gunning. According to Gadd, he knew she was the perfect candidate from the start.</p><p>Gadd tells This Morning, "I adored her. There were times when we'd be shooting shots and the camera would be over my shoulder and on her, and I would forget to say my lines because I was like, 'Gosh, she's so good. Sorry, I messed up.'"</p><p>Gadd continued on with some high praise, calling Gunning the best actress in the UK.</p><p>"She's remarkable. I think she's the best actress in this country. I really do. I always had her in mind for Martha. I saw her on TV shows, I always saw a light, a darkness, I saw it all. I was pushing her from the start. She's great."</p><p>The moment can be seen below around the 4:00 minute mark.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/1-64.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Kim Kardashian And Tom Brady’s Relationship Is More Confusing Than Ever After His Netflix Roast</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Netflix's The Greatest Roast of All Time: Tom Brady showed a tense moment between Kim Kardashian and Brady, but where do they stand today?</span><p>As expected, Gadd got strong praise from fans for his interview comments.</p><p>Fans wrote, "Richard is so incredibly brave for not only telling his story but physically acting this trauma out for the second time. I can’t even imagine how difficult that must be. We are all proud of you Richard."</p><p>Another fan wrote, "Never seen such realistic portrayal in media of what a victim has to go through and experience after being victimised. I haven't cried this much in a long time.
