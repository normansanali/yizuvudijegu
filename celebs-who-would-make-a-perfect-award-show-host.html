jokes and underwhelming entertainment, or they can excite the audience and make the evening memorable.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A slew of comedians, performers, and late night TV hosts have taken a shot at hosting an award show, but haven't always ended up on top.</p><p>However, we think these eight celebrities would make for perfect award show hosts, whether it's because they have a connection to a particular show or they're a beloved comedic actor, they would certainly keep the night alive.</p><h2 id=jennifer-coolidge><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Jennifer Coolidge</span></h2><p>Coolidge has always been a <a href=#>beloved actress</a> through her roles in comedies like Legally Blonde and A Cinderella Story, but she's gained even more momentum and critical acclaim with her recent role on the HBO show The White Lotus. Coolidge is one of the funniest actresses working today and would have no problem with poking fun at both the audience and herself as a host, as well as bring forth female representation award shows are often lacking.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After winning an Emmy for her White Lotus role in 2022, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">one of the best moments</a> came during her speech where she started dancing and telling the program to hold on while they tried to get her off-stage before she was done. The moment not only became one of the most talked about in recent award show history, but it teased us with the possibility of how she would command a stage as host of one of these award shows.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:<a href=#> What's Next For Jennifer Coolidge After Her White Lotus Season 2 Exit?</a></span></p><h2 id=lin-manuel-miranda><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Lin-Manuel Miranda</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Creating sensational numbers from Disney smash hits like Moana and Encanto and in the theater world with the acclaimed Hamilton and In The Heights, Miranda has seemingly <a href=#>taken over the musical world</a>. It would seem only fitting if he were to become the host of the Tony Awards, as he's one of the most celebrated and noteworthy figures in Broadway history.</p><p>But his effortless charm could benefit any award show, complete with plenty of musical numbers. It seems like a no-brainer that Miranda would have been a host by now, especially after his massive success with the film Encanto, but he hasn't yet added award show host to his extensive catalog.</p><h2 id=nicolas-cage><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Nicolas Cage</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Cage has garnered a<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> bizarre reputation</a> on the internet, as he can often be regarded jokingly and respectively as both a meme and an icon. Similarly to Coolidge, Cage is wholly unique and if he were to host an award show he would definitely bring in the numbers, if for no other reason than to see what would happen under his command.</p><p>If given hosting duties, anything could happen, and that's exactly the kind of buzz most of these award shows need after dwindling viewership of late. He's another example of a celebrity who can dish it out but also take it in abundance.</p><h2 id=samuel-l-jackson><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Samuel L. Jackson</span></h2><p>This entry might need to filter his jokes a bit as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">his favorite words</a> aren't necessarily TV friendly, but Samuel L. Jackson's brashness and honesty is what would make him an excellent host. He's not afraid to make a statement and that's exactly why his fans love him.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If the Emmys or Oscars are looking to bring in massive numbers, Jackson is a great choice. He's already hosted the BET Awards, proving he's up to the task. He's the perfect combination of having respect for the many creative industries and knowing when to let loose.</p><h2 id=morgan-freeman><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Morgan Freeman</span></h2><p>There are few celebrities with such an iconic voice and presence as Morgan Freeman, so it's rather shocking that he's never been tasked with hosting an award show. Starring in over <a href=#>one hundred films</a>, Freeman is a Hollywood legend that is a perfect example of the kind of actor that the award shows should want to have leading their ceremonies.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even reading out the names or presenters or from the envelopes would have people glued to their screens just to hear his melodic voice.</p><h2 id=billy-eichner><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Billy Eichner</span></h2><p>He may not be everyone's cup of tea, but Billy Eichner - famous for his show Billy on the Street - would not only bring needed LGBTQ+ representation but plenty of self-deprecating jokes and pop culture references that would make the evening of any ceremony interesting.</p><p>We aren't sure which show would benefit from his hosting the most between the Tonys, as he's a massive fan of musicals, or the Golden Globes, as he's proven to be a constant source of knowledge on the industry. But he's not afraid to delve into some edgier jokes, that would serve as conversation pieces after the ceremony concludes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>We'd also love to see him bring his<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Billy on the Street regular Elena</a> on stage or his idol Meryl Streep.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Billy Eichner Had To Go Against Hollywood In Order To Make Bros</a></span></p><h2 id=jack-black><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Jack Black</span></h2><p>This is another celeb we are in complete awe over the fact that they've never hosted an award show. Black is revered as one of the best comedic actors in Hollywood and a talent musician with the rock duo Tenacious D, but what truly makes him a great candidate is his love for his fellow performers.</p><p>Black is able to poke fun but in a loving way that makes him a joy to watch by all ages. We can already imagine the electricity he would bring to the stage if given the chance.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>9 Reasons Why Jack Black Is Beloved By His Fans</a></span></p><h2 id=billy-porter><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Billy Porter</span></h2><p>This trendsetter has left a mark on Broadway, fashion, and television, but he needs to add hosting to the list. A dazzling performer on stage, ours screens, and the runway, not only would Porter bring a certain flair to hosting any show, whether it be the Tonys or the Oscars, he'd do it with a striking confidence in a series of stunning costume changes.</p><p>Having a Black, gay man host a major award show would be one for the books and provide the much-needed representation that many of these award shows lack. And Porter would be one of the few hosts that can actually sing!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGianqSVl8Buw8eoZLCnpaGxbrnApJxmmV2lsrOyxJyrZpmnlr%2BledKhprBlmKTAtXs%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./cindy-crawford-rande-gerbers-family-album-with-kaia-presley.html>&#171;&nbsp;Cindy Crawford, Rande Gerber's Family Album With Kaia, Presley</a>
