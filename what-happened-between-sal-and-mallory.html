"I don't think she deserved it. I think I should have spoken my truth more, and I don't want to protect Mallory anymore. I don't need to protect Mallory anymore. I'm done."</p><p>Sal went on to describe why he actually decided to say no to Mallory at the altar. He said that the two had made plans to hang out and go shopping about a week before their wedding.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"I didn't hear for her for two hours. I end up going to a couple of stores, waiting for her, because she says she's going to meet me," he continued. "But, the last phone call that I got from her, she was slurring her words, and I just started walking back to the apartment."</p><p>On the way back to his apartment, Sal said he saw a man throw a cup out of the window, and that he then heard a female voice say, "That's my coffee."</p><p>"I was like, 'Wow, that sounded a lot like Mallory.' I look into the car, and Mallory's in there with some random guy, just drunk," he added. He then addressed his siblings. "That was the night that I actually came and stayed with you all, 'cause I couldn't stay at that apartment that night."</p><p>Later on in the episode, Mallory addressed Sal's side, and she shared her own side of what happened leading up to the wedding.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Mallory shared her side of the story during the closing credits of 'After the Altar.'</h2><p>While Sal's version of events implied that his then-fiancé was drunk and hanging out with a "random guy," Mallory said that the man in the car was actually a longtime friend of hers. She also said that she told Sal this, and that he was "play[ing] the f-----g victim."</p><p>"I was out with friends 'cause I hadn't seen them in a while, and we were just catching up. We talked about it," Mallory said in a confessional, before mentioning that the man in the car was her pal.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"This is somebody who I've known most of my life, and who is one of my closest friends.

I don't know why this is even being brought up," she added. "Wow, anything to just play the f-----g victim."</p><p>Mallory and Sal may disagree about that fated night before their wedding, but the two are now in agreement that their relationship never would have worked outside of the pods.</p><p>Love Is Blind Season 2, which includes the three-part After the Altar series, is available to stream on Netflix now.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIyhmKmolaOypXnBnquwnZWjerSty2aYp5xdoq6tuM6rsA%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./zahra-anderson-height-age-boyfriend-biography-wiki-net-worth-12311-html.html>&#171;&nbsp;Zahra Anderson Height, Age, Boyfriend, Biography, Wiki, Net Worth</a>
