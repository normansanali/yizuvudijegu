After Lulu put on a dismally physical performance trying to get their tribe members up a wall, Belo finished the puzzle first, and Reba placed second.</p><p data-characters=441 data-current-count=733 data-injectable=true>During Sept. 28’s episode of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">On Fire: The Official Survivor Podcast</a>, longtime host and showrunner <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jeff Probst</a> revealed that with their victory, Belo earned a big advantage. They had the opportunity to send one player to Lulu’s beach to live with them while they prepared for Tribal Council. In doing so, the player would learn the dynamics of their tribe’s opponent while also potentially creating new bonds and alliances.</p><h2 id=h-the-twist-also-allowed-the-opposing-tribe-member-to-vote-for-a-lulu-player-to-go-home data-injectable=false>The twist also allowed the opposing tribe member to vote for a Lulu player to go home</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=87 data-current-count=387 data-injectable=false>“There’s one scene that you actually need to know about,” Jeff said.</p><p data-characters=419 data-current-count=806 data-injectable=true>Jeff revealed that Belo sent Kendra McQuarrie, the 31-year-old bartender from Steamboat Springs, CO, to Lulu. “Kendra goes over and she literally just hangs out there watching all of them scramble, but they now realize Kendra’s here,” the host said. “So, they’re trying to figure out who they’re going to vote for. But, they’re also aware that somebody is eavesdropping.”</p><p data-characters=295 data-current-count=295 data-injectable=false>Jeff said that none of the Lulu contestants were privy to another element of the twist. Kendra was also tasked with casting a vote against one of the six of them. Before Lulu made the journey to Tribal Council, Kendra went to Tree Mail and secretly wrote Brandon’s name down, he revealed.</p><p data-characters=404 data-current-count=699 data-injectable=true>Brandon was highly dismayed for large portions of episode 1. He was the big reason why Lulu didn’t capture supplies in the opening challenge, and his Immunity Challenge performance was not much better. Back at camp before Tribal, Brandon said he was planning on leaning into the Shot in the Dark game mechanic where he could wager his vote for a one-in-six chance of receiving safety from the vote.</p><p data-characters=111 data-current-count=111 data-injectable=false>“So, we get to Tribal Council, in theory, Brandon already has one vote cast against him,” he said.</p><p data-characters=335 data-current-count=446 data-injectable=true>However, Kendra’s surprise vote had no impact on the game because Hannah chose to quit Survivor 45. Instead of each player taking a trip to the voting urn to write Hannah’s name down, they all verbally agreed to honor Hannah’s wish, and she was sent packing. The host also gave Hannah the honor of snuffing her torch.</p><p data-characters=220 data-current-count=220 data-injectable=false>“So, when it came time to have to trim the episode down, as much as we loved this scene, because it didn’t really play out the way we intended with the vote and everything, we had to cut it,” Jeff said.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Kendra’s time on Lulu may be beneficial to her later in the game, the host said</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=520 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=200 data-current-count=200 data-injectable=false>The twist was a big opportunity for Kendra to make inroads with other competitors outside of her Belo tribe. And that could come in handy for her later in the experience if she plays her cards right.</p><p data-characters=318 data-current-count=518 data-injectable=true>“Obviously, Kendra now has been to Lulu,” he said. “She’s formed some kind of relationships with those players, and she has some kind of information. So, if there’s a tribe swap or if she makes the merge, who knows how that information or those relationships might come into play.”</p><p data-characters=284 data-current-count=284 data-injectable=false>He didn’t go into further detail about how Kendra’s game was ultimately affected by the twist. Also, we don’t know if the same thing will happen next episode — the first-place tribe at the Immunity Challenge sends a member of their squad to the loser’s camp.</p><p data-characters=103 data-current-count=387 data-injectable=false>You can catch episode 2 of Survivor 45 on Wednesday, Oct. 4 at 8 p.m. ET/PT on CBS and Paramount Plus.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3yiecyaoaiqXanEqr%2FTZq6aq12YwrV5zq6rZqeWYsC2vtWiraiqXWmCbrHPoqqonJVifnA%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./antonio-cromartie-net-worth-2024-2.html>&#171;&nbsp;Antonio Cromartie Net Worth 2024</a>
