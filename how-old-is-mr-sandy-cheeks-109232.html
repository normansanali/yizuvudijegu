She usually wears an astronaut-like suit while walking around Bikini Bottom while wearing a purple and green bikini inside her tree dome.</p><p>This article, Sandy Cheeks, is property of KGBSpetsnaz. Alexandra J. “Sandy” Cheeks (born November 17, 1981) is a squirrel who is the only land creature on the show SpongeBob SquarePants. She usually wears an astronaut-like suit while walking around Bikini Bottom while wearing a purple and green bikini inside her tree dome.</p><p>Sandra “Sandy” Jennifer Cheeks is a female squirrel from Texas. She is a friend of SpongeBob and Patrick. She wears an air helmet and an astronaut suit to get oxygen and has a heavy Southern accent. She is one of the Gal Pals, along with Karen, Mrs. Puff, and Pearl .</p><p>Sandy Cheeks is the main tritagonist of SpongeBob SquarePants and SpongeBob SquarePants S. She is one of the member of the Team SpongeBob . In episode 1, she saw Cyrax attacked her treedome and fight with him.</p><h2>When is Sandy’s birthday?</h2><p>According to the SpongeBob SquarePants Annual 2014 book published by the Egmont Group, Sandy’s birthday is on<strong> November 17.</strong> She was born a twin, alongside Randy Cheeks, to Ma and Pa Cheeks in Houston, Texas, USA.</p><p>Along with Plankton and Karen, Sandy is one of the most intelligent and levelheaded characters on the show. She is a multi-talented scientist and inventor and originally came to Bikini Bottom to study sea creatures and their lifestyles. In ” Chimps Ahoy ,” it is revealed that she is employed by a trio of chimpanzees from the surface, named Professor Percy, Dr. Marmalade and Lord Reginald. As an inventor, Sandy is capable of creating extremely advanced devices with ease. Her inventions include a manned spaceship, a teleporter, a submarine that can shrink to microscopic size and go inside a person’s body, a robot in ” What Ever Happened to SpongeBob? ,” and even a Protogenerator 2000 cloning device as seen in ” Overbooked .”</p><p>Sandy and Squidward have had<strong> limited</strong> interactions. Squidward doesn’t seem to know who she is on a few occasions. In ” SpongeBob SquarePants vs. The Big One ,” Squidward asks “Who are you?” and in ” Rodeo Daze ,” he mistakes her name for “Sally.” However, Sandy is happy to help Squidward, such as in ” Squidtastic Voyage ” when she helps him revive his clarinet reed from his throat. Then in The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water, she was seen carrying him to safety when he was almost crushed by skating humans and letting him ride on her back when they’re chasing Burger Beard. At times like in the episode ” Patrick! The Game ,” Sandy can easily get annoyed by Squidward’s attitude towards things, like his attitude towards Patrick’s game.</p><p>Sandy is very fond of her homeland and its culture, as most notably seen in the episode<strong> “Texas, </strong>” in which she was homesick and considers leaving Bikini Bottom to return to Texas. In that same episode, she takes great offense at SpongeBob and Patrick’s negative insults about Texas and violently attacks them when they continue to make fun of it.</p><p>Sandy first met SpongeBob when he<strong> saw her wrestling a giant clam</strong> and ran down to save her. Since then, Sandy has been one of SpongeBob’s best friends, and she enjoys various activities with him such as karate. She also enjoys going to Goo Lagoon with him and lifting weights. Despite their tight friendship, Sandy has gotten annoyed by SpongeBob in various episodes, such as ” Sandy’s Rocket ” and “Texas.”</p><p>She had a lot of experience there and won’t stand any insults of it, as shown in “Texas,” where she cries several times throughout the episode<strong> because she missed her old homeland and even made a song dedicated to it.</strong> SpongeBob and Patrick then make fun of the state. She is offended by them mocking Texas, and thus she chases both of them down and brutally attacks Patrick.</p><p>Sandy is most commonly seen wearing her suit for oxygen when she is outside of her treedome. The suit is white and has a yellow square-shaped patch with an acorn on it. It also has three rings on the sleeves, two red rings and one blue ring in the center. The suit comes with a big glass helmet with a yellow center and five pink floral petals. She also wears graphite boots with one red dot on each side of them.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><h2>Who voices Sandy Cheeks?</h2><p>Voice.

She met Donna Grillo, a casting director, on a sidewalk. Lawrence was with a friend who knew Grillo, and she said Lawrence had an interesting voice.</p><p>Sandy is shown to possess a<strong> number of tough, tomboyish character traits and interests;</strong> she is skilled at karate, engages in bodybuilding, and is a rodeo champion. She is also a close friend of Patrick Star, SpongeBob’s best friend and neighbor, though she sometimes gets annoyed by him.</p><p>Inside the treedome, her normal attire consists of<strong> a green and purple bikini.</strong></p><p>American.
