Considered the quintessential “proto-punk” band, a term which refers to the garage bands of the 1960s and 1970s who influenced the punk movement, The Stooges and Iggy Pop have been a part of the <a href=#>Rock and Roll Hall of Fame </a>since 2010.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Why Is Tik Tok Canceling John Lennon?</a></span></p><p>Iggy Pop is as much of an icon for his eccentric yet fearless self-expression as he is for his music. Since their debut album, The Stooges have recorded 5 studio albums and Iggy has recorded 20 solo studio albums. He is also a jack of all trades because in addition to his music he acts, writes, and is even a scholarly academic.</p><p>After a career spanning over 5 decades and a smorgasbord of credits to his name, some fans might wonder how much is rock legend Iggy Pop Worth today?</p><h2 id=his-band-rsquo-s-first-album---lsquo-the-stooges-rsquo><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>His Band’s First Album - ‘The Stooges’</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Iggy and The Stooges broke into the music scene in 1969 with the release of their self-titled first album The Stooges. The album peaked as the 106th album on the Billboard music charts but gained a cult following as more proto-punk bands began to make the scene. The album also features one of the band’s most famous anthems, “I Wanna Be Your Dog.” Originally, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he was credited as “Iggy Stooge”</a> when the album first came out, not as Iggy Pop. Later albums would include Raw Power, Fun House, and nearly a dozen live albums.</p><h2 id=first-solo-album---lsquo-the-idiot-rsquo><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>First Solo Album - ‘The Idiot’</span></h2><p>As The Stooges began to perform more and as their audience grew Iggy began his solo ventures as a recording artist. His first solo album, The Idiot, was released in 1977 and was co-written with another rock-n-roll music legend, David Bowie. Later on one of Iggy’s songs, “The Passenger” from his second album Lust for Life, would become one of his most famous tracks. David Bowie played keyboard for Iggy on both albums.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=his-non-musical-writing><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>His Non-Musical Writing</span></h2><p>Some of the more conservative academics of the world might be surprised to learn that the godfather of punk rock is also an incredibly well-read intellectual. In the highly respected literary journal Classics Ireland,<a href=#>Pop published a short article titled Casaer Lives in 1995</a>. The article was a reflection on writer Edward Gibbon’s Decline And Fall Of The Roman Empire and its influence on Iggy and his work. Considering the fact that his debut solo album, The Idiot, is named after a book by the Russian author Fyodor Dostoyevsky, it really shouldn’t be that much of a surprise that Iggy Pop is so literate.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-rock-and-roll-hall-of-fame><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>The Rock And Roll Hall of Fame</span></h2><p>Iggy Pop and The Stooges were inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 2010 by Billie Joe Armstrong from the liberal pop-punk band Green Day. Ten years later, Iggy would grace the stage again as the inductor for Trent Reznor and his band Nine Inch Nails.</p><h2 id=movies-lsquo-coffee-and-cigarettes-rsquo><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Movies / ‘Coffee And Cigarettes’</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Like many other musicians, Iggy Pop is also an actor, and his IMDb credit list counts over 60 performances to date. Iggy works frequently with indie filmmaker Jim Jarmush and can be seen in several of his films, most notably as himself opposite Tom Waits (another frequent Jarmush collaborator) in Coffee and Cigarettes. He has worked with Hairspray director John Waters on his film Cry Baby, where Pop met the film’s star Johnny Depp (one of Depp’s first film roles after 21 Jump Street) and the two started a lifelong friendship. The proto-punk legend has also graced the screen to entertain children in family films. Hardcore fans of early 2000s Nickelodeon might remember him for an appearance in the films Snow Day and The Rugrats Movie.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Much Is 'Hairspray' Creator John Waters Worth In 2021?</a></span></p><h2 id=voice-acting><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Voice Acting</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In addition to lending his voice to the above-mentioned Nickelodeon film, Iggy can be heard in several animated television shows. He played Little Donald Rumsfield in the short-lived Comedy Central series Lil Bush, a lampoon of the administration and family of then-president George W. Bush. He has also been in Adult Swim’s Mr. Pickles, Seth Macfarlane’s American Dad, and although uncredited, according to IMDb he can be heard in the English language version of Persepolis, a film based on the popular graphic novel by Iranian author Marjane Satrapi. He also voiced a radio disc jockey in the video game Grand Theft Auto IV, which also features the Stooges’ classic song “I Wanna Be Your Dog.”</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Why Indie Sensation Mitski Likes To Live Outside The Public Eye</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=his-total-net-worth-today><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>His Total Net Worth Today</span></h2><p>Thanks to his acting, music, and voice-over career, and his collaboration with other rock legends like David Bowie, Iggy Pop now claims a net worth of $20 to $24 million. That number is likely to stay steady, or even grow because new generations continue to discover his work and the other creations born out of the proto-punk era. Despite his advanced age of 74, Iggy Pop continues to write, perform, and act.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>A Tribe Called Quest, What Are The Band Members Up To</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGigoJ%2BpYr2wvIyrppyjXaGyqLHNnWSnnaRixLC%2B06FkraeUlsZuwMeeZKysn6S0pr%2BO</p></div><div id=links><a href=./jazz-and-tae-gcvx-html.html>&#171;&nbsp;Jazz and Tae (Web Group) - Members profile, Facts, Wiki, Achievements, Net worth 2024 (updated)</a>
